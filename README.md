# News parser from yahoo.com (test task)

Import news and entertainment from yahoo.com. Every two hours, the relevant sections of the site are updated using rss yahoo.com. Separate post_type news and entertainment are created. Images are copied to the site and attached to the corresponding record.

After deactivation of the plug-in, the task-crowns for the update are deleted, and then when they are reactivated, they are added again.

IMPORTANTLY!! After downloading the plugin, change the name of the archive to news-parser-from-yahoo
